<p>The only way for reaching me right now is by sending me email to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:yoosofan&#64;chmail.ir">yoosofan&#64;chmail.ir</a> or <a class="reference external" href="mailto:yoosofan&#64;mailfa.com">yoosofan&#64;mailfa.com</a></p>
<p>Please send me an email if you ever can because I do not know that you may able to see this website or not.
Also you may not able to send any email outside of Iran unless you use the chmail.ir or mailfa.ir</p>
<p>Unfortunately, mail server of kashanu is not working too.</p>
<p>Hope you understand what situation we (Iranian) are in. The government filter internet and we have an internal country network while even many websites hosted in Iran have been banned too.</p>
