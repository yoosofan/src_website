	abstract = {Let G be  a simple graph and {V(G)} and {E(G)} be vertices and edges of G, respectively. The distance between each of the two vertecies (u,v) is defined as the minimum number of vertices which should be traversed so that they can reach each other. The Wiener index of  this graph, denoted by {W(G),} is defined as the sum of all distances between unordered pairs of vertices[1] . A conjunction of nanocone and cylindrical carbon cluster is recognized as the single-wall carbon nanohorn {(SWHN)} [2]. In this article, the Wiener index of  some nanohorn is calculated.},
