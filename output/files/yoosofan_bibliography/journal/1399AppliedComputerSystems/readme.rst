Abstract
=========
Deep learning is a new branch of machine learning, which is widely used by researchers in a lot of artificial intelligence applications, including signal processing and computer vision. The present research investigates the use of deep learning to solve the hand gesture recognition (HGR) problem and proposes two models using deep learning architecture. The first model comprises a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network with a long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM). The accuracy of model achieves up to 82 % when fed by colour channel, and 89 % when fed by depth channel. The second model comprises two parallel convolutional neural networks, which are merged by a merge layer, and a recurrent neural network with a long short-term memory fed by RGB-D. The accuracy of the latest model achieves up to 93 %.

Keywords: Computer Vision (CV); Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Deep Learning; Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR); Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM)
