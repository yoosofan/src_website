philosophy of teaching
=======================

I believe that education serves the purpose of bettering society by preparing students for solving real-life problems, teaching them how to learn new skills autonomously for new situations, and fostering their cooperative abilities for group projects. I also believe that all students can learn, but they have different needs, preferences, and styles. Therefore, I try to ask different questions for different students in class and motivate them to engage in conversations that would help their learning.

My goals for my students are to enable them to use their knowledge and experience they acquired in the university in real-life jobs and tasks. I want them to be confident, creative, and critical thinkers who can apply their skills in various contexts and situations. My goals for myself are to have a better understanding of new technologies and techniques to use for teaching, to improve my relationship with students toward better teaching and understanding, and to improve my own skills in what I teach so I can have a better grasp of what I teach and how they can apply it.

I abide by certain standards that ensure that me and my students acquire a certain degree of understanding about the courses. I follow the curriculum guidelines and learning outcomes set by the department and the university, but I also adapt them to the needs and interests of my students. I also use various assessment methods and tools to measure the progress and achievement of my students.

I think that being a good teacher requires being good at what I teach, having good ability to interact with students, using the best tools and techniques for teaching, updating my knowledge on a daily basis, having one-to-one interaction with students and interactive teaching instead of being passive, and encouraging students to learn through peer-to-peer conversations and reviewing course materials.

I incorporate new techniques, activities, curriculum, and technology into my teaching by changing and updating the content of courses based on new trends and student feedback. I also use technology wisely and appropriately in teaching, because it can be irrelevant at best or damaging at worst if used incorrectly. Sometimes using pen and paper is a good choice even for some parts of computer courses. I am honest about the origin of parts of materials in the slides, and I give credit to the sources I use. I also use open source and free tools for creating content so that all students can use them freely without any complication. My slide repository shows some of my efforts in this regard: https://github.com/yoosofan/slide/
